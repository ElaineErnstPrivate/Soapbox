## Overview

Soapbox is a small app where you can download photos from a Flickr account, and save the photos as your favourites which you would be able to browse offline. 

The user must be autheticated to use the app. The user can create a new account via the create account button. Once an account has been created the user can log in. 
One of the features implemented to improve the user experience was auto login, this means that users don't have to imput their credentials every time they open the app.
 
 

## Setup
